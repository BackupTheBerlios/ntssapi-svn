Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? </span><br>:17 <span style="color:black"> Even so every good tree  bringeth forth good fruit; but  a corrupt tree  bringeth forth evil fruit. </span><br>:18 <span style="color:black"> A good tree cannot  bring forth evil fruit, neither  can  a corrupt tree  bring forth good fruit. </span><br>:19 <span style="color:black">Every tree  that  bringeth not forth good fruit  is  hewn down, and cast into  the fire. </span><br>:20 <span style="color:black">Wherefore by their fruits  ye  shall know them. </span><br>:21 <span style="color:black">Not  every one  that saith  unto me, Lord, Lord,  shall enter into the kingdom  of heaven; but  he that doeth the will  of my Father which  is in heaven. </span><br>:22 <span style="color:black">Many  will say  to me in that day, Lord, Lord,  have  we not prophesied  in thy name and  in thy name  have  cast out devils? and  in thy name done many  wonderful works? </span><br>:23 <span style="color:black">And then  will  I profess  unto them,  I never knew you: depart from me,  ye that work iniquity. </span><br>:24 <span style="color:black">Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings  of mine, and doeth them,  I  will liken him  unto  a wise man, which built his house upon  a rock: </span><br>:25 <span style="color:black">And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and  beat upon that house; and  it fell not; for  it  was founded upon  a rock. </span><br>:26 <span style="color:black">And  every one  that heareth these sayings  of mine, and doeth them not,  shall  be likened  unto  a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: </span><br>:27 <span style="color:black">And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and  beat upon that house; and  it fell: and great was the fall  of it. </span><br>:28 <span style="color:black">And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: </span><br>:29 <span style="color:black">For he taught them as  one having authority, and not as the scribes. </span><br></body></html>
